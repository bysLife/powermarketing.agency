		<h1> Here's my blueprint</h1><br><h3>Make sure to read everything. . . .</h3>
<br><br>


<h4>1. Funnels</h4><br><br>
<p>
Websites are old. They were last decade. The best way to get your customers to buy from you is through a step by step funnel or a multi page website specifically designed and written all with one objective in mind.
<br><br></p>
<center><b><p>TO make your more money and bring your more <u>hard core, high paying customers.</u> </p></b></center>
<br><br><p>
You don’t get this with a website. Websites are built just to educate your propsective customer but does nothing to push a customer into contacting you and speaking with you directly. <br><br>
<b>Funnels do. </b><br><br>
It’s simple easy and more efficient <br><br>

If you don’t already have this, you’ve lost most of your ROI
<br><br><br><br>
</p>

<h4>2. Messenger Marketing</h4> <br><br>
<p>
Hello 2018! This is what it’s all about. If you are serious about your business and want to automate your customer service, make your customers happier and even convert prospects into clients. You ABSOUTELY require messenger chatbots. These are built to have a conversation with your prospects before you make direct contact with them. The best part is these are automated and don’t require you to touch them at all. </p>
<br><br>
<h4>3. Email</h4><br><br>
<p>
Do you still do print marketing? 
<br><br>
Great, but if you really want to maximize ROI, email is where it’s at. You spend a fraction to nothing to get someone’s email and then you can send them messages for free in a place that people check constantly. 
<br><br>
Most people toss their mail when they first get it unless its a bill.  <br>
Pile A has everything they care about<br>
Pile B has things they have never heard about or things they think are ads. <br>Where is your ad being placed?
<br><br></p>

<h4>4. Advanced Retargeting</h4>
<p><br><br>
Have you looked at buying something on amazon to only later see it following you around the web. Youtube. . . .  your favorite website and usually offering an insanely good deal?
<br><br>
Yea?<br><br>

You’ve experienced advanced retargeting and it’s one of the cheapest and easiest ways to bring back customers over and over to you. 
<br><br></p>
<h4>5. Review ranking</h4><br><br>
<p>
How do you look to google? are you ranking first in the search results? Do you have hundreds of 5 star reviews or do you have a bunch of complaints clogging your google review board?<br><br>

This will seriously hurt your business and prevent many prospective customers from contacting you. <br>
When they first look up service professionals like you, their first impression and the one they value the most is from their peers. <br>
That’s why yelp is huge!<br><br>

And just based on this, your business will either sink or swim. 
<br><br><p>

<br><h3>
Listen up! Because if you think this is hard and a lot of work . . . . I have a solution for you. . . . .
<br><br>
Just like everything above can be automated, I can have someone automate the whole process for you.
<br><br></h3>
<p>
Running all of these is an extremely time consuming process. Some require technical know how. TO perfect it, takes years. BUT, when implemented by a pro, it’s seamless and brings back king size results. 
<br><br>
Why not save your time and still reap the benefits by hiring a professional. I’m available for consults either by phone, email or in person if you are in the Kennesaw, Marietta area. 
<br><br>
I guarantee just the consult will open your eyes to the new world of marketing and get you one step closer to growing your business exponentially. 
<br><br>
